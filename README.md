## 🏆 Acknowledgements

Dixture is based on the great [AutoFixture](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture) library that exists on the `.NET` environment.

I've used this library for so long for my Unit and Integration tests that I needed to, somehow, get some of its functionality when working on my `Deno`'s tests.

Thus I began working on this project.
